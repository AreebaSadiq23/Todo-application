## Stylistic Changes to Cancel Button

I have added specific styling for the "Cancel" button within the task form on the dashboard. This includes:
*   A transparent background with a subtle border.
*   A default text color that matches the foreground.
*   Hover effects that slightly change the background and border color for better visual feedback.

These styles are defined in `frontend/app/(main)/tasks/tasks.module.css` under the `.buttonOutline` class.

Please run your application and check the dashboard page to see the updated styling of the "Cancel" button. Let me know if this meets your expectations!
